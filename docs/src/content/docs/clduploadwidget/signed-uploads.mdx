Signing requests is an easy way to provide enhanced security for your file uploads. This helps
deter people from making unauthenticated uploads to your cloud.

## Configuring Signed Uploads

Setting up CldUploadWidget to sign uploads is as simple as passing an API endpoint as a prop:

<CodeBlock alwaysExpanded>
```jsx
---
import { CldUploadWidget } from 'astro-cloudinary';
---
<CldUploadWidget signatureEndpoint="<API Endpoint (ex: /api/sign-cloudinary-params)>">
  <button>Upload</button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```
</CodeBlock>

However, that API endpoint needs to return a specific shape in order to properly communicate
with the CldUploadWidget.

## API Endpoint to Sign Requests

When working in Astro, we gain access to a server environment through both somewhat traditional means
and serverless functions.

This means, we can use the [Cloudinary Node SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration)
in order to easily sign our requests.

To start off, install the Cloudinary Node SDK with:

<CodeBlock alwaysExpanded>
```
npm install cloudinary
```
</CodeBlock>

In order to sign our requests, we'll need to use our Cloudinary API Key and Secret, so set additional
environment variables:

<CodeBlock alwaysExpanded>
```
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="<Your API Key>"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="<Your API Secret>"
```
</CodeBlock>

Then, we want to create a new API endpoint:

Create a new API route file such as `src/pages/api/sign-cloudinary-params.ts` and inside add the following:

<CodeBlock>
```js
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

export const prerender = false;

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => {
  const body = await request.json();
  const { paramsToSign } = body;
  const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(paramsToSign, import.meta.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET);
  return Response.json({ signature });
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Whatever path you use will now be the value of `signatureEndpoint` for the CldUploadWidget.
